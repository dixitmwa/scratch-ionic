# Quick Fix Instructions

## Current Issue
- App was crashing due to `ActivityCallback` method signature issues in your custom plugin
- Recording button disabled

## Immediate Solution - Test @capgo Plugin

I've temporarily switched your app to use the `@capgo/capacitor-screen-recorder` plugin which is more stable.

### Test Steps:

1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   npx cap run android --live-reload
   ```

2. **Navigate to Playground page**

3. **Click record button** and check console for logs

4. **Watch for these console messages:**
   ```
   ScreenRecordingHelper.isSupported: true/false
   ScreenRecordingHelper.startRecording called
   Starting screen recording with @capgo plugin...
   ```

## Expected Results

### ✅ **Success:**
- Button should not be disabled anymore
- Should see "Recording started successfully" toast
- Button turns red while recording
- "Recording stopped successfully" toast when stopped

### ❌ **If Still Issues:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Look at Android logcat for native errors: `npx cap run android --log`

## Quick Switches

### Switch Back to Custom Plugin:
In `PlaygroundPage.tsx` line 10, change:
```typescript
// From:
import { CapgoScreenRecordingHelper as ScreenRecordingHelper } from '../utils/CapgoScreenRecordingHelper';

// To:
import { ScreenRecordingHelper } from '../utils/ScreenRecordingHelper';
```

### If @capgo Also Fails:
The issue might be deeper - possibly Android version compatibility or permission issues.

## Debug Console Commands

When testing, open Chrome DevTools and check console for:
- `ScreenRecordingHelper.isSupported: true` ← Should show true on Android
- Any error messages starting with "ScreenRecordingHelper"

Let me know what console messages you see and I'll provide the next fix!
