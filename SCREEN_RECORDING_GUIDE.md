# Screen Recording Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the screen recording implementation for the Ionic React Scratch app.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom Plugin Approach
We've implemented screen recording using your custom `screenrecorder` plugin which provides native screen recording capabilities for Android and iOS.

### 2. Helper Class
Created `ScreenRecordingHelper` utility class that provides:
- Platform support detection
- Recording state management  
- Proper error handling
- Clean API interface

## Files Modified

### `src/pages/PlaygroundPage.tsx`
- Updated to use `ScreenRecordingHelper` instead of direct plugin calls
- Added visual feedback when recording (red background on record button)
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added loading states and disabled buttons during operations

### `src/utils/ScreenRecordingHelper.ts` (New)
- Centralized screen recording logic
- Better error handling and type safety
- State management for recording status

### `android/app/src/main/java/io/ionic/starter/MainActivity.java`
- Registered the custom `ExamplePlugin` (ScreenRecorder)

## How It Works

### Starting Recording
1. User clicks the record button in PlaygroundPage
2. `ScreenRecordingHelper.startRecording()` is called
3. Platform support is checked
4. Recording permission is requested (handled by Android system)
5. Native recording starts
6. UI is updated to show recording state

### Stopping Recording
1. User clicks the record button again (now red indicating active recording)
2. `ScreenRecordingHelper.stopRecording()` is called
3. Native recording stops
4. Video file path is returned
5. User is notified of successful save

## Android Permissions Required
The following permissions are already configured in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `RECORD_AUDIO` - For audio recording
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - For background recording service
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION` - For screen projection
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - For saving video files

## Video Storage
Videos are saved to the app's external files directory with filename format:
`recorded_video_[timestamp].mp4`

## Testing Instructions

### Development (Web)
- Screen recording will show "only available on native platforms" message
- This is expected behavior as screen recording requires native capabilities

### Android Device/Emulator
1. Build and run on Android: `npx cap run android`
2. Navigate to the playground page
3. Click the record button (should request permission on first use)
4. Perform actions in the game
5. Click record button again to stop
6. Check toast message for video save location

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Not Starting
- Check device permissions in Android settings
- Ensure app has screen recording/display capture permission
- Check logcat for error messages: `npx cap run android --log`

### No Video File Returned
- Check Android storage permissions
- Verify external storage is available
- Check logcat for MediaRecorder errors

### Plugin Not Found Error
- Run `npx cap sync` to ensure plugin is registered
- Check that `screenrecorder` dependency is in package.json
- Verify MainActivity.java includes the plugin registration

## Alternative Solutions

If the custom plugin doesn't work, you can try:

1. **@capgo/capacitor-screen-recorder**: Already in dependencies
   ```typescript
   import { ScreenRecorder } from '@capgo/capacitor-screen-recorder';
   ```

2. **capacitor-screen-record**: Another popular option
   ```bash
   npm install capacitor-screen-record
   ```

3. **Native Implementation**: Implement directly in native code for maximum control

## Benefits of Current Implementation

1. **Modular**: Helper class can be reused across components
2. **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper error types
3. **User Friendly**: Clear feedback and loading states
4. **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling
5. **Native Performance**: Uses native MediaRecorder for optimal quality

## Next Steps

1. Test on real Android device
2. Implement iOS version of the plugin if needed
3. Add video playback/preview functionality
4. Add video sharing capabilities
5. Implement video compression options
