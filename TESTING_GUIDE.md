# Testing Screen Recording - Quick Guide

## Current Status
✅ Fixed the "Wrong number of arguments" error in your custom plugin
✅ Updated the plugin to use the older `handleOnActivityResult` method instead of `@ActivityCallback`
✅ Created helper classes for both your custom plugin and @capgo fallback

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test with Custom Plugin (Recommended)
1. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   npx cap run android
   ```

2. **Navigate to Playground Page**
3. **Click the Record Button** - Should request permission first time
4. **Perform some actions in the game**
5. **Click Record Button again to stop**
6. **Check the toast message for success/error**

### Option 2: If Custom Plugin Still Fails, Switch to @capgo
If you still get crashes, you can quickly switch to the more stable @capgo plugin:

1. **In `PlaygroundPage.tsx`, change the import:**
   ```typescript
   // Change this line:
   import { ScreenRecordingHelper } from '../utils/ScreenRecordingHelper';
   
   // To this:
   import { ScreenRecordingHelper } from '../utils/CapgoScreenRecordingHelper';
   ```

2. **Sync and test:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   npx cap run android
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If App Still Crashes:
1. **Check Logcat for detailed errors:**
   ```bash
   npx cap run android --log
   ```

2. **Look for these specific errors:**
   - Permission denied
   - MediaRecorder errors
   - Plugin not found

### If Recording Doesn't Start:
1. **Check Android Settings:**
   - Go to App Settings → Permissions
   - Ensure "Display over other apps" is enabled
   - Check microphone permission

2. **Try recording a different app first** to verify system screen recording works

### If No Video File Returned:
1. **Check device storage space**
2. **Look in device gallery** (some plugins save directly there)
3. **Check Android file manager** in `/Android/data/io.ionic.starter/files/Movies/`

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Success Flow:**
1. First click → Permission dialog appears
2. Grant permission → "Recording started successfully" toast
3. Record button turns red with white icon
4. Second click → "Recording saved: [file path]" toast
5. Button returns to normal state

❌ **If Still Failing:**
The issue might be with device compatibility or Android version. Some Android versions have stricter screen recording policies.

## Alternative Solutions

If both plugins fail, you could also:
1. **Use a different screen recording library** like `react-native-record-screen`
2. **Implement native Android code directly** in your MainActivity
3. **Use a simple video capture API** for specific game moments instead of full screen recording
